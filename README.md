Description:
This repository contains a collection of microservices developed for the Absence Management System. Each microservice is designed to handle specific responsibilities related to student attendance tracking, including facial recognition, RFID verification, student and course management, as well as absence monitoring and reporting.

Microservices Included:

Facial Recognition Microservice: Validates student identification through facial recognition technology.
RFID Verification Microservice: Manages RFID card verification for student identification.
Student and Course Management Microservice: Handles student information, course details, and schedules for both students and teachers.
Absence Monitoring Microservice: Monitors student attendance, generates absence reports, and manages absence alerts.
Technologies Used:

Symfony 7: PHP framework used for developing the microservices.
Vue.js: Frontend framework for building interactive user interfaces.
Docker: Containerization platform for packaging each microservice with its dependencies.
API Platform: Framework for building APIs, facilitating communication between microservices.
MySQL: Relational database used for storing application data.
Deployment Strategy:
The microservices are designed to be deployed independently, allowing for scalability and flexibility in managing the absence management system. Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines are set up to automate the deployment process, ensuring rapid and reliable delivery of updates.
